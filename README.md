# IPL-Price-Predictor
A machine learning project to determine cricket player prices in the Indian Premier League annual auctions. The dataset has been built by scraping data from the howstat website. A Support Vector Regression (SVR) model has been developed to predict prices for batsman and wicketkeepers, and a Linear Regression model has been built to predict prices for bowlers and all-rounders. The entire project has been built using Python and its libraries.
